NetworkManager live VM scripts
------------------------------

This set of scripts can be used to build a live initramfs image suitable
for testing NetworkManager in a virtual environment. The scripts themselves
are intended to be used by a power user who can adapt them to their needs.
The result, on the contrary, is intended to be used by anyone who wants to
play with NetworkManager on the command line.

Building the initramfs image:

sudo ./build.sh [-n name] [-b branch/commit]

You may have to update ./build.sh to suit your distribution. The included
is prepared for Fedora 18 and the image is also build using Fedora 18
repositories.

Then you can distribute the self-extracting archive and run in on other machines:

./nm-live-vm-bundle.sh
