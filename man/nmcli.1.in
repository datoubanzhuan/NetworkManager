.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nmcli
is a command\(hyline tool for controlling NetworkManager and reporting network
status. It can be utilized as a replacement for \fInm\(hyapplet\fP or other
graphical clients. \fInmcli\fP is used to create, display, edit, delete, activate,
and deactivate network connections, as well as control and display network device
status.
.P
Typical uses include:
.IP \(em 4
Scripts: utilize NetworkManager via \fInmcli\fP instead of managing network
connections manually.  \fInmcli\fP supports a terse output format which is better
suited for script processing. Note that NetworkManager can also execute scripts,
called "dispatcher scripts", in response to network events. See
\fBNetworkManager\fP for details about these dispatcher scripts.
.IP \(em 4
Servers, headless machines, and terminals:  \fInmcli\fP can be used to control
NetworkManager without a GUI, including creating, editing, starting and stopping
network connections and viewing network status.
.SS \fIOPTIONS\fP
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-terse
Output is terse.  This mode is designed and suitable for computer (script)
processing.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-pretty
Output is pretty. This causes \fInmcli\fP to produce easily readable outputs
for humans, i.e. values are aligned, headers are printed, etc.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mode tabular | multiline
Switch between \fItabular\fP and \fImultiline\fP output.
If omitted, default is \fItabular\fP for most commands. For the commands
producing more structured information, that cannot be displayed on a single
line, default is \fImultiline\fP. Currently, they are:
.br
.nf
  'nmcli connection show configured <ID>'
  'nmcli connection show active <ID>'
  'nmcli device show'
.fi
\fItabular\fP   \(en Output is a table where each line describes a single entry.
Columns define particular properties of the entry.
.br
\fImultiline\fP \(en Each entry comprises multiple lines, each property on its own
line. The values are prefixed with the property name.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fields <field1,field2,...> | all | common
This option is used to specify what fields (column names) should be printed.
Valid field names differ for specific commands. List available fields by
providing an invalid value to the \fI\-\-fields\fP option.
.br
\fIall\fP is used to print all valid field values of the command.
\fIcommon\fP is used to print common field values of the command.
If omitted, default is \fIcommon\fP.
The option is mandatory when \fI\-\-terse\fP is used.  In this case, generic
values \fIall\fP and \fIcommon\fP cannot be used.  (This is to maintain
compatibility when new fields are added in the future).
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-escape yes | no
Whether to escape ':' and '\\' characters in terse tabular mode.  The escape
character is '\\'.
If omitted, default is \fIyes\fP.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nocheck
This option can be used to force \fInmcli\fP to skip checking \fInmcli\fP and
\fINetworkManager\fP version compatibility. Use it with care, because using
incompatible versions may produce incorrect results.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-ask
When using this option \fInmcli\fP will stop and ask for any missing required
arguments, so do not use this option for non-interactive purposes like scripts.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-wait <seconds>
This option sets a timeout period for which \fInmcli\fP will wait for \fINetworkManager\fP
to finsh operations. It is especially useful for commands that may take a longer time to
complete, e.g. connection activation.
Specifying a value of \fB0\fP instructs \fInmcli\fP not to wait but to exit immediately
with a status of success. The default value depends on the executed command.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show \fInmcli\fP version.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print help information.
.SS \fIOBJECT\fP
.TP
.B general \- general \fINetworkManager\fP status and operations
.br
Use this object to show NetworkManager status and permissions. You can also get
and change system hostname, as well as NetworkManager logging level and domains.
.TP
.SS \fICOMMAND\fP := { status | hostname | permissions | logging }
.sp
.RS
.TP
.B status
.br
Show overall status of NetworkManager. This is the default action, when no additional
command is provided for \fIgeneral\fP object.
.TP
.B hostname [<hostname>]
.br
Get and change system hostname. With no arguments, this prints currently configured hostname.
When you pass a hostname, it will be handed over to NetworkManager to be set as a new system
hostname.
.TP
.B permissions
.br
Show the permissions a caller has for various authenticated operations that
NetworkManager provides, like enable and disable networking, changing Wi\(hyFi,
WWAN, and WiMAX state, modifying connections, etc.
.TP
.B logging [level <log level>] [domains <log domains>]
.br
Get and change \fINetworkManager\fP logging level and domains. Without any argument
current logging level and domains are shown. In order to change logging state, provide
\fIlevel\fP and, or, \fIdomain\fP parameters. See \fBNetworkManager.conf\fP for available
level and domain values.
.RE

.TP
.B networking \- get or set general networking state of NetworkManager
.br
Use this object to show NetworkManager networking status, or to enable and disable

.B connection \- start, stop, and manage network connections
.sp
NetworkManager stores all network configuration as \fIconnections\fP, which are
collections of data (Layer2 details, IP addressing, etc.) that describe
how to create or connect to a network.  A connection is \fIactive\fP when
a device uses that connection's configuration to create or connect to a network.
There may be multiple connections that apply to a device, but only one of them
can be active on that device at any given time. The additional connections can
be used to allow quick switching between different networks and configurations.
.sp
Consider a machine which is usually connected to a DHCP-enabled network, but
sometimes connected to a testing network which uses static IP addressing.  Instead
of manually reconfiguring eth0 each time the network is changed, the settings can
be saved as two connections which both apply to eth0, one for DHCP (called
"default") and one with the static addressing details (called "testing").  When
connected to the DHCP-enabled network the user would run "nmcli con up default"
, and when connected to the static network the user would run "nmcli con up testing".

Shows connections which are currently used by a device to connect to a network.
Without a parameter, all active connections are listed.  In order to show the
connection details, \fI<ID>\fP must be provided. \fIid\fP, \fIuuid\fP,
\fIpath\fP and \fIapath\fP keywords can be used if \fI<ID>\fP is ambiguous.
.RS

if a device is using that connection.  Without a parameter, all connections
are listed.  In order to show connection details, \fI<ID>\fP must be
provided. \fIid\fP, \fIuuid\fP and \fIpath\fP keywords can be used if
\fI<ID>\fP is ambiguous. See \fBshow active\fP above for the description of
the keywords.
.br
When no command is given to the \fIconnection\fP object, the default action
is 'nmcli connection show configured'.

.B up [ id | uuid | path ] <ID> [ifname <ifname>] [ap <BSSID>] [nsp <name>]
.RE
.RS
.B up ifname <ifname> [ap <BSSID>] [nsp <name>]
.RS
.br
Activate a connection.  The connection is identified by its name, UUID or D-Bus
path. If <ID> is ambiguous, a keyword \fIid\fP, \fIuuid\fP or \fIpath\fP can be
used.  When requiring a particular device to activate the connection on, the
\fIifname\fP option with interface name should be given.  If the <ID> is not
given an \fIifname\fP is required, and NetworkManager will activate the best
available connection for the given \fIifname\fP.  In case of a VPN connection,
the \fIifname\fP option specifies the device of the base connection. The
\fIap\fP option specify what particular AP should be used in case of a Wi\(hyFi
connection.
.br
If '--wait' option is not specified, the default timeout will be 90 seconds.

.TP
.B down [ id | uuid | path | apath ] <ID>
.br
Deactivate a connection from a device without preventing the device from
further auto-activation.
.sp
Be aware that this command deactivates the specified active connection. The device
on which the connection was active, is still ready to connect and will perform
auto-activation by looking for a suitable connection that has the 'autoconnect'
flag set. This includes the just deactivated connection, so if the connection is set
to auto-connect, it will be automatically started on the disconnected device again.
.br
In most cases you may want to use \fIdevice disconnect\fP command instead.
.sp
The connection is identified by its name, UUID or D-Bus path.
If <ID> is ambiguous, a keyword \fIid\fP, \fIuuid\fP, \fIpath\fP or
\fIapath\fP can be used.

.br
If '--wait' option is not specified, the default timeout will be 10 seconds.
.TP
.B wifi [list [ifname <ifname>] [bssid <BSSID>]]
.br
List available Wi\(hyFi access points. The \fIifname\fP and \fIbssid\fP options
can be used to list APs for a particular interface or with a specific BSSID,
respectively.
.TP
.B wifi connect <(B)SSID> [password <password>] [wep\-key\-type key|phrase] [ifname <ifname>] [bssid <BSSID>] [name <name>] [private yes|no]
.br
Connect to a Wi\(hyFi network specified by SSID or BSSID. The command creates a new
connection and then activates it on a device. This is a command\(hyline counterpart
of clicking an SSID in a GUI client. The command always creates a new connection
and thus it is mainly useful for connecting to new Wi\(hyFi networks. If a connection
for the network already exists, it is better to bring up (activate) the existing connection
as follows: \fInmcli con up id <name>\fP. Note that only open, WEP and WPA\(hyPSK networks
are supported at the moment. It is also supposed that IP configuration is obtained via
DHCP.
.br
If '--wait' option is not specified, the default timeout will be 90 seconds.
.RS
.PP
Available options are:
.IP \fIpassword\fP 13
\(en password for secured networks (WEP or WPA)
.IP \fIwep\-key\-type\fP 13
\(en type of WEP secret, either \fIkey\fP for ASCII/HEX key or \fIphrase\fP for passphrase
.IP \fIifname\fP 13
\(en interface that will be used for activation
.IP \fIbssid\fP 13
\(en if specified, the created connection will be restricted just for the BSSID
.IP \fIname\fP 13
\(en if specified, the connection will use the name (else NM creates a name itself)
.IP \fIprivate\fP 13
\(en if set to \fByes\fP, the connection will only be visible to the user who created it.
Otherwise the connection is system\(hywide, which is the default.
.RE
.TP
.B wifi rescan [[ifname] <ifname>]
.br
Request that \fINetworkManager\fP immediately re-scan for available access points.
NetworkManager scans Wi\(hyFi networks periodically, but in some cases it can be
useful to start scanning manually (e.g. after resuming the computer).
This command does not show the APs, use 'nmcli device wifi list' for that.
.TP
.B wimax [list [ifname <ifname>] [nsp <name>]]
.br
List available WiMAX NSP. The \fIifname\fP and \fInsp\fP options
can be used to list networks for a particular interface or with a specific
NSP, respectively.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
\fInmcli\fP's behavior is affected by the following environment variables.
.IP "LC_ALL" 13
If set to a non\(hyempty string value, it overrides the values of all the other
internationalization variables.
.IP "LC_MESSAGES" 13
Determines the locale to be used for internationalized messages.
.IP "LANG" 13
Provides a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset
or null.

.RE
Internationalization notes:
.br
Be aware that \fInmcli\fP is localized and that is why the output depends on
your environment. This is important to realize especially when you parse the
output.
.br
Call \fInmcli\fP as \fBLC_ALL=C nmcli\fP to be sure the locale is
set to "C" while executing in a script.

\fBLC_ALL\fP, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fP, \fBLANG\fP variables specify the LC_MESSAGES
locale category (in that order), which determines the language that \fInmcli\fP
uses for messages.  The "C" locale is used if none of these variables are set,
and this locale uses English messages.

.SH EXIT STATUS
\fInmcli\fP exits with status 0 if it succeeds, a value greater than 0 is
returned if an error occurs.
.IP "0" 4
Success \(en indicates the operation succeeded
.IP "1" 4
Unknown or unspecified error
.IP "2" 4
Invalid user input, wrong \fInmcli\fP invocation
.IP "3" 4
Timeout expired (see \fI\-\-wait\fP option)
.IP "4" 4
Connection activation failed
.IP "5" 4
Connection deactivation failed
.IP "6" 4
Disconnecting device failed
.IP "7" 4
Connection deletion failed
.IP "8" 4
NetworkManager is not running
.IP "9" 4
\fInmcli\fP and \fINetworkManager\fP versions mismatch
.IP "10" 4
Connection, device, or access point does not exist.

.SH EXAMPLES

.IP
activates the connection with name "My wired connection" on interface eth0.
The \-p option makes nmcli show progress of the activation.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli con up 6b028a27\-6dc9\-4411\-9886\-e9ad1dd43761 ap 00:3A:98:7C:42:D3\fP\fP"
.IP
connects the Wi\(hyFi connection with UUID 6b028a27\-6dc9\-4411\-9886\-e9ad1dd43761 to the AP
with BSSID 00:3A:98:7C:42:D3.

.IP
shows the status for all devices.

.IP "\fB\f(CWnmcli dev disconnect em2\fP\fP"
.IP
disconnects a connection on interface em2 and marks the device as unavailable for
auto\(hyconnecting. As a result, no connection will automatically be activated on the
